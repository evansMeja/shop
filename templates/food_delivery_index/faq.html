                We take such matters very seriously and will look into individual cases thoroughly. Any 
                sample that falls under the below categories should not be thrown away before taking photo proof 
                and emailing the photo of the affected sample and your D.O (Delivery Order) to us at contact@tuzowe.co.ke (if applicable).
              </p>

              1. In the event that the sample you've received is unsatisfactory in any way you perceive, we will require photo proof of the sample and your D.O (Delivery Order) as well and you may be required to send us back the sample for close inspection and review before a decision is made to re-send a sample to you at no cost, subject to availability. The postage cost will be credited back to your account after we receive the returned item.
 </p>

2. In the event that you receive an expired product, we will require clear photo proof of the sample and its expiry date for close inspection and review before a decision is made to re-send a sample to you at no cost, subject to availability.

3. In the event that you've received the wrong sample, we will require photo proof of the wrongly sent sample and D.O (Delivery Order) and after reviewing, we'll re-send the correct sample to you at no cost, subject to availability.
